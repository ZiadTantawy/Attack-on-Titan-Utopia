As part of of the CSEN-401 course at the GUC, we were assigned to develop Attack on Titan: Utopia, a single player, endless, tower defence game created using Java and JavaFX based on and inspired by the hit animated series Attack on Titan.
- Developed a turn-based tower defense game with selectable difficulty modes (easy/hard).
- Implemented Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, designing and structuring classes for Titans, weapons, walls, and lanes. Utilized inheritance, interfaces, and encapsulation to ensure modular and reusable   code.
- Designed and styled a dynamic user interface using JavaFX and CSS, creating an interactive experience.
