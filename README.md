As part of of the CSEN-401 course at the GUC, we were assigned to create Attack on Titan: Utopia, a single player, endless, tower defence game created using Java and JavaFX based on and inspired by the hit animated series Attack on Titan. We utilized all aspects of object-oriented programming as well as creating the user-interface using JavaFX.
